# Telligent Community Extensions
####Dependencies
The Telligent Community Extensions require that you have installed and are running Telligent Community.  As such, this library has dependencies on assemblies that for licensing reasons are not made available as part of this solution.  You will need to obtain these assemblies from the \Web\bin folder under the installation directory and copy all the dlls to the \src\lib\Telligent folder before compiling.

####Where is the documentation?
Documentation will be coming soon.

####How do I report a bug?

####Can I contribute?
Yes, we will have more details soon on how you can contribute.
